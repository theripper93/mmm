{"name":"Introduction","content":"<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p>Welcome, prospective student, to Maxwell's Manual of Malicious Maladies (and Miraculous Medicine). I am the distinguished surgeon, Maxwell Gonzolaz, though you may have heard of me by my popular moniker: Maxwell Hacks-Well. In this comprehensive (and dare I say, preeminent) guide you will find descriptions of all manner of injury: physical, mental, spiritual, and arcane. I will take you on a sanguinary journey through a universe of traumatic possibility and illustrate how you (an industrious and clever  budding surgeon) can wrest your companions from the foul- smelling maw of death and dismemberment.  You will also find within a variety of cutting-edge surgeries (pun intended) which are guaranteed* to get your compatriots back on their feet, especially if their feet were missing to begin with. But wait, my friend, there's more! When the worst happens (and you aren't around to prevent it, of course), maiming and dismemberment are no longer the end. Thanks to modern medical -- and magical -- technology there are a variety of options described within to get your kickers back kicking and your snatchers back snatching. Brilliant! So, my young pupil, oil up your bone saw, sharpen your scalpel, and get those bandages boiling, it's time to save some lives!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>How to Use This Book</h2>\n<p>This book is organized into three parts. The first part is a series of tables describing Lingering Injuries based on the 13 different damage types (acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, piercing, poison, psychic, radiant, slashing, and thunder). Each table has a variety of injuries, conditions, and effects that increase the risk of combat and provide interesting and dire narrative opportunities. The second part is a system for characters to perform surgery. Surgery is a new and unique skill challenge that has the potential -- with a bit of talent and luck -- to treat some of the injuries described in the first section. The final section is a collection of mundane and magical items focussed on accessibility and allowing options for adventurers with physical disabilities.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Part 1: Lingering Injuries</h2>\n<p>Adventuring is a dangerous business, and combat a more dangerous business still. Your players are consistently encountering monsters, traps, hazards, and all manner of opportunities for injury and death. The Lingering Injury tables in this book provide an interesting way to give your campaign's conflict a risk of more permanent consequences.</p>\n<p>Why play with Lingering Injuries though?</p>\n<p><strong>Overcome Your Limitations</strong>. Dungeons and Dragons is a game about narrative, creative problem solving, and overcoming obstacles. Whether it be an alchemist who paid an arm and a leg for his powers, a blind geomancer who \"sees\" through vibrations in the earth, a psionic professor confined to his wheelchair, or a blind attorney with his own version of justice, there are plenty of examples of characters in the media who never let their physical limitations stand in the way of their goals. Injuries are an opportunity for your characters to experience unique challenges and triumph over them. There is no injury so great that your character cannot be a hero.</p>\n<p><strong>Risk and Reward.</strong> When characters can seemingly heal from even the more grievous injuries with a full night's rest, sometimes it's difficult to maintain immersion. Lingering injuries provide a ever-present risk that any combat encounter will have a serious consequence. Even so, the Lingering Injury tables were designed so that the probability the most serious injuries (such as losing an arm, leg, vision, or hearing) are relatively small compared to that chance your characters will end up with a purely cosmetic scar.</p>\n<p><strong>Scars are Fun.</strong> These charts give your players the opportunity to pick up purely cosmetic reminders of struggles past (some of which even have some unique properties!). Give your players the opportunity to show off their battle scars in the local tavern. Let your players laugh at the hideous scar one took when they were fighting rats at Level 1 now that they are fighting dragons at Level 12. Let your Barbarian (who seems to take 90% of the party's damage) turn into a physical roadmap of your adventure history. Scars are interesting way to evolve your characters' appearance and bookmark the memories of their past struggles.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Part 2: Surgical Treatment</h2>\n<p>There are some injuries that potions, salves, and bandages just aren't enough for. Part 2 of this book describes Surgery, a new skill challenge that allows your characters the chance to mitigate the effects of injuries they've taken. With some skill and luck, your characters will be able to reattach an arm severed by a mighty attack, remove an arrowhead left behind in the chest of their comrade, neutralize acid threatening to permanently damage the vision of the sharp-eyed rogue, and more. Surgery is not without its risks, however, and no surgery is guaranteed to be successful. Ultimately, Surgery offers a second chance for your characters to avoid the permanent effects of some of the more dire lingering injuries.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Part 3: Items, Magical and Mundane</h2>\n<p>Despite your characters' best effort to prevent them, permanent injuries are going to occur. The final part of this book contains a variety of options -- both magical and mundane -- focussed on accessibility, so that no physical limitation will stand in their way.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Magical Healing</h1>\n<p><strong>Maxwell Says:</strong> \"Magical healing is a fickle thing, my friend. I've travelled far and wide, studied with clerics and scholars, and let me tell you, it's a rare spell that can do what I can with a scalpel and some catgut.</p>\n<p>\"Your humble teacher Maxwell has been in one or two scraps himself, and seen a thing or three. Magical healing is great for getting you back on your toes in a pinch, but it sometimes it responds.... oddly. Most often it seals up your wounds lickity-split without so much as a weal or welt left behind. Other times, you're left with a wicked looking cicatrix that looks like it's been with you for since that time you played with daddy's sheep shears as a child, even though he told you not to.</p>\n<p>\"Now, -- and mind you, this is still just a theoretical postulation -- I believe that magical healing (to its capacity) acts on the reflected image of oneself that lies deep within our inner soul. When a particularly grievous wound is taken it damages not only our physical body, but our spiritual sense of self. It traumatically changes our inner perception, and when we receive magical healing, that perception is outwardly reflected on the body.</p>\n<p>\"Simply put: 'See stars? Get scars.' \"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>The Regenerate Spell</h2>\n<p>Regenerate is a 7th level spell available to the Bard, Cleric, and Druid that threatens to make the entire lingering injury system obsolete. Where is the threat when a 13th level character can cure even the direst of injuries with the only cost being a night's rest? While most campaigns are played between 1st and 12th level, if you enjoy this system and want to DM for a higher-level campaign, you may want to alter the Regenerate spell as follows:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Regenerate</strong></h3>\n<p><em>7th-level transmutation</em></p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 minute</p>\n<p><strong>Range</strong>: touch</p>\n<p><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a prayer wheel, holy water, and healing potions worth at least 400 gold, which the spell consumes)</p>\n<p><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 hour</p>\n<p>You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains 4d8 + 15 hit points. For the duration of the spell, the target regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute). The target’s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump. This spell does not heal any injury or scar that is older than one week.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This optional change gives Regenerate a new material component which may or may not be available to the characters, and lets them make the choice between attempting surgery or consuming potentially precious healing resources. It also does not instantly remove the scars and other marks your players may have collected during their adventures, so long as they are older than one week.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Interaction with Injuries</h2>\n<p>Though the DM always has the final ruling, magical healing is intended to be ineffective at treating lingering injuries unless the treatment section of the lingering injury chart specifies otherwise. Narratively, the magic is considered ineffective at treating the source of the injury or effect. For example, magical healing fixes up the damage from a standard long sword wound without any trouble, but can't knit together a broken bone.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Cspu3pxFr7tu7SU7":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.HB6kJCMVbfngKR9f"}},"_id":"rwZiLOgLOgQHiMXv"}

{"name":"Part 1: Lingering Injuries","content":"<h1>Part 1: Lingering Injuries</h1>\n<p><strong>Maxwell Says:</strong> \"From acid to thunder, you'll find all manner of injury, insult, infection, and affliction listed below. It is my humble hope that you witness only enough of them to keep you comfortably in business.\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>How to Use This Section</h1>\n<p>Below you will find three different sections. The first section is the Lingering Injury tables themselves. Your characters will roll on these tables to determine what manner of injury or affliction they've received. Second are the Anatomy Tables. You may need to use these tables to determine location of a scar or injury. The third section contains the mechanical effects for two new conditions, nonfunctional and missing. Some lingering injuries may apply one of these effects to a limb or other body part.</p>\n<p><strong>All these tables are not included in this Journal Entries but are in a table compendium, they will be pulled automatically by automations (if enabled). You can always use the chat command /mmmm to bring up the table selector. The chat command can also be used to directly roll a specific table (eg. /mmmm radiant)</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>When Do Characters Roll on the Lingering injury Tables?</h2>\n<p>There are two different circumstances that will cause characters to roll on the Linger Injury tables:</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Hits.</strong> Any time one of your characters receives a critical hit from any source (combat, traps, spell attacks, etc.) they roll 3d6 on the table that matches that damage type. If the critical hit deals more than one type of damage, they roll on the on the table for the type that dealt the majority.</p>\n<p><strong>Critically Failed Saving Throws.</strong> Any time one of your characters critically fails a saving throw that would cause them to take damage (including spells, traps, environmental effects, etc.) they roll 3d6 on the table that matches that damage type. If the failed saving throw would cause them to take more than one type of damage, they roll on the table for the type that dealt the majority.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step By Step</h2>\n<h3><strong>1.Roll on the Lingering Injury Tables</strong></h3>\n<p>The character receives a critical hit or critically fails a saving throw. Allow them to roll 3d6 to determine the injury or affliction they'll receive.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Roll on the Anatomy Tables, if needed</strong></h3>\n<p>Some options may have you roll on an Anatomy Table to determine the location of the injury or scar. The DM may always directly choose the location instead of rolling if it better fits the situation's narrative. If, by chance, you roll a situation that is physically impossible or simply doesn't make sense given the established narrative (one of your characters takes shrapnel to their left leg when it is already missing, for example), then there is no effect, and the character (luckily) escapes the situation without an injury.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Narrate the Injury and its Effects</strong></h3>\n<p>The DM narrates the result of the injury and describes any of its mechanical effects to the player. You may need to consult information in the section that describes the nonfunctional and missing conditions.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Treatment</strong></h3>\n<p>Some (though not all) injuries are treatable. Treatment allows characters to reduce the duration of injuries, or even potentially cure them altogether. Unless otherwise stated, any treatment that requires a Wisdom (Medicine) check takes one action. In general, it is assumed that each character will have one opportunity to attempt this Wisdom (Medicine) check. The DM may allow repeated attempts at a failed treatment check at their discretion, but after a success further treatment attempts are not allowed (to further decrease the injury’s duration).</p>\n<p>Assume that all characters are aware of the information in the treatment section of the lingering injury charts and understand how to tend to these injuries. As long as a character has a Healer's Kit it is assumed they will have any equipment needed for a treatment that requires a Wisdom (Medicine) check.</p>\n<p>Some more serious injuries will require surgery to treat. Surgery is a skill challenge described in Part 2 of this book. Even if an injury has no treatment listed, the DM is welcome to work with the character to find a cure that works well within the campaign's narrative.</p>","img":"https://i.imgur.com/nKHhlJ9.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Cspu3pxFr7tu7SU7":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.tg4O9TlFzxXbcZkp"}},"_id":"6BqWInbEf51sLxID"}
{"name":"Part 2: Surgery","content":"<h1>Part 2: Surgery</h1>\n<p><strong>Maxwell Says:</strong> \"Ah, surgery. Nothing makes you feel quite so alive as being elbow deep in blood and humors. Surgery, as you will find out my friend, is more of an art than a science. Something out of place? Excise it. Something need to be in place? Stitch it. Once you know the basics, my apt pupil, it's off on your own like a baby bird falling from the nest.</p>\n<h2>Prepping the Patient</h2>\n<p>Surgery pits the skill of the surgeon against the life force of the patient. Surgeries are meant to be difficult, and many of them may require multiple consecutive attempts before the surgery is successful. Be careful, however, as the longer the surgery takes, the more unstable your patient may become...</p>\n<p>Attempting surgery requires three things:</p>\n<p><strong>A Set of Surgeons' Tools.</strong> From catgut to clamps, from bandages to bone saws, surgeon's tools contain all the necessary equipment to attempt any surgery.</p>\n<p><strong>A Character Proficient with Surgeons' Tools.</strong> Surgery is a specialized skill and impossible to attempt by anyone untrained.</p>\n<p><strong>A Controlled Environment.</strong> This means a stable setting free of threats and distractions for the duration of the surgery. Ideally a dedicated room. At the least, a stable encampment.</p>\n<p><strong>Concentration.</strong> Surgery requires concentration, so the surgeon may not also concentrate on a spell at the same time as performing surgery.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Initiating Surgery</h2>\n<p>Once the three requirements above are met, a character may initiate the skill challenge. Each round of the skill challenge takes place as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Surgeons' Tools Check.</strong> The character attempting the surgery makes an surgeons' tools ability check (generally using either Dexterity or Intelligence) opposed by the DC of the surgery. Each attempt takes 30 minutes. If the character meets or exceeds the DC, the surgery is a success. If they fail to meet the DC, they have not yet succeeded and may be able to reattempt.</p>\n<p><strong>Max Hit Point Damage.</strong> The character undergoing surgery takes damage to their maximum hit points equal to their class's hit die (for example, a Barbarian takes 1d12 of damage to their maximum hit points). If the DC is failed by 10 or more, the character undergoing surgery takes two hit dice worth of damage to their max hit points instead. This damage represents trauma to the body through surgery and loss of blood. It occurs whether or not the surgery was a success.</p>\n<p><strong>Decision to Continue.</strong> If the DC was not met, it increases (cumulatively) by 1. The surgeon may choose to either proceed with surgery and make another surgeons' tools ability check or abandon the surgery.</p>\n<p><strong>Dying Patients.</strong> If the character's maximum hit points are ever reduced to 0, they are dying. If the surgeon immediately abandons the surgery at this point they are stabilized and regain 1 to their max hit points. If the surgeon proceeds with the surgery, the character dies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Assisting with Surgery</h2>\n<p><strong>Maxwell Says: </strong>\"I always strive to have the maximum available amount of hands possible, both in my help and on my patients.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Second Surgeon.</strong> A character may use the help action to assist with surgery only if they are also proficient in surgeons' tools. In this case, the surgeon rolls their surgeons' tools check with advantage.</p>\n<p><strong>Assessing the Patient</strong> A character proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) may assist the surgeon by assessing the patient's condition. After max hit point damage is done, they may roll a Wisdom (Medicine) ability check:</p>\n<table style=\"width:99.1477%;height:85px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:21.6812%;height:17px\"><strong>Wisdom (Medicine) DC</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:77.6024%;height:17px\"><strong>Information Known</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:21.6812%;height:17px\">8</td>\n<td style=\"width:77.6024%;height:17px\">You know if the patient has 0 HP and is dying.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:21.6812%;height:17px\">10</td>\n<td style=\"width:77.6024%;height:17px\">You know if the patient has 15 or less HP.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:21.6812%;height:17px\">15</td>\n<td style=\"width:77.6024%;height:17px\">You know if the patient is above or below half their original maximum health.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:21.6812%;height:17px\">20</td>\n<td style=\"width:77.6024%;height:17px\">You know the patient's exact HP</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If the surgeon chooses to assess the patient, they make their next surgeons' tools ability check with disadvantage. Splitting their attention between the patient's vital signs and the surgery itself is distracting and they need their whole focus to do their best surgical work.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Ways to Help. </strong>Any spell, ability, or mechanic that gives advantage or a bonus to ability checks functions as normal, but only pertains to a single surgeons' tools check unless its duration extends beyond 30 minutes. These include bonuses gained from effects such as (but not limited to) Inspiration, Bardic Inspiration, Guidance, Enhance Ability, and the Lucky feat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Recovery</h2>\n<p>Damage to maximum hit points inflicted by surgery recovers at a rate of 1 class HD + the character's Constitution modifier per long rest. For example, a Barbarian with a Constitution score of 18 would recover 1d12 + 4 to their maximum hit points after a long rest. The Greater Restoration spell cures this damage to maximum hit points as usual.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Finding a Surgeon</h2>\n<p>The adventuring party should be able to find surgeons in any major city with little trouble, though they may not be cheap. The average surgeon charges 500 gold for a surgery, and the most skilled surgeons charge up to double that (though for a higher success rate, it may be worth the money).</p>\n<p>Finding a surgeon in a mid-sized town or smaller village is more difficult. There is a 50% chance an NPC proficient with surgeons' tools resides in any given mid-sized town, and only a 10% chance in a smaller village. Even if the party manages to find someone who knows their way around a scalpel, often these people are more used to treating injured farm animals than they are people.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>List of Common Surgeries</h1>\n<p>Below is a collection of standard surgeries that you are able to perform with a set of surgeons' tools. The specific surgery required for each different injury is listed in the treatment area of the Lingering Injuries Tables.</p>\n<h2>General Surgery</h2>\n<p>General surgery is the most standard surgery and can be used for a wide variety of applications. Removing the broken tip of a weapon from inside someone, stitching back together a perforated bowel, or removing necrotic tissue so a wound can properly heal would all be considered General Surgery. General surgery has no additional rules or requirements unless they are listed in the treatment section of the injury.</p>\n<h2>Save Sense Surgery</h2>\n<p>A Save Sense Surgery attempts to save one of the character's senses, such as vision or hearing. Reconstructing a slashed ear or neutralizing acid splashed into an eye are examples of injuries requiring a Save Sense Surgery. Sensory structures are generally delicate and small, and as a result, all one is often able to do is repair the surrounding area, apply salves and bandages, and hope for the best. As a result, you may only ever make one surgeon's tool's ability check for a Save Sense Surgery. If it is not successful on the very first try, then the surgery was a failure. After a Save Sense Surgery, characters must wait 1d4 days before they remove the bandages and dressings to see if the surgery was successful.</p>\n<h2>Save Limb Surgery</h2>\n<p>A Save Limb Surgery is attempted when you want to reverse damage done to a limb or small appendage. Reattaching a severed limb, treating an immolated arm, or reconstructing a crushed leg are all examples of injuries requiring a Save Limb Surgery. When a limb is missing, the surgeon is racing against the clock. Each hour that the limb is considered missing before the surgery begins increases the DC of the surgery by 1. A Gentle Repose or Feign Death spell cast on the limb eliminates this DC increase for their duration. A limb recovering from this type of surgery is weaker than normal and takes a penalty similar to if the Resurrection spell had been cast on it: The limb takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks requiring its use. Every time the character finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.</p>\n<h2>Amputation</h2>\n<p>Sometimes a body part is beyond saving. Sometimes a character is bitten in the arm by a werewolf and wants to prevent lycanthropy by any means necessary. For those occasions, there is Amputation. Amputation grants the missing condition to a body part. Amputation's DC is always 10. 29</p>","img":"https://i.imgur.com/nKHhlJ9.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Cspu3pxFr7tu7SU7":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Jr4aQ8ksWV1Q77nE"}},"_id":"0PUSwOrAEGovg11w"}

{"name":"The Nonfunctional and Missing Conditions","content":"<h1>The Nonfunctional and Missing Conditions</h1>\n<p>Maxwell's Manual introduces two new conditions, <strong>nonfunctional </strong>and <strong>missing</strong>. These two conditions are the same in terms of how they affect characters mechanically. They may differ, however, in how the injury is treated surgically, or what types of items are available to characters to assist with their injury. If the distinction is important, it will be listed in the surgery or item's description.</p>\n<p><strong>Nonfunctional </strong>describes a limb or sense that has been damaged to the point where it ceases to function. A leg broken by a greatclub, ears temporarily deafened by a violent percussive attack, or fingers in the early stages of frostbite are considered to have the nonfunctional condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Missing </strong>describes a limb or sense that is permanently gone, destroyed, or otherwise unattached from the body. An arm severed by the mighty swing of a greatsword, a leg incinerated by the flame of a dragon, or an untreated spray of acid into a character's eyes are all considered to have the missing condition.</p>\n<p>The following tables describe the mechanical effect that nonfunctional or missing body parts have on players: Note: Some of these effects are the same as the Lingering Injury Table found on page 272 of the DMG, while others are expanded on or completely new. If playing with Maxwell's Manual, it is recommended you only use the effects listed here.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong>The Remarkable Adaptability of the Human (and elf, dwarf, etc.) Body</strong></h3>\n<p>The human body is an incredible thing, and the human will even more so. The longer a person lives with an injury or disability, the more they are able to adapt to it. Many of the penalties listed here may be able to be overcome with practice, training, and resilience.</p>\n<p><strong>Maxwell Says:</strong> \"I once, in the folly of youth, made the lamentable error of challenging a man missing an arm to an arm wrestling competition. Little did I consider his normal day involved doing the same work with one arm that I did with two. \"Long story short, I ended up setting my first broken bone.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Vision</h2>\n<table style=\"width:99.1549%;height:52px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.2599%;height:17px\"><strong>#</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:85.0299%;height:17px\"><strong>Effect</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:18px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.2599%;height:18px\">One Eye</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.0299%;height:18px\">You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and on ranged attack rolls.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.2599%;height:17px\">Both Eyes</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.0299%;height:17px\">You are <strong>blinded.</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Hearing</h2>\n<table style=\"width:836.5px;height:52px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:116.5px;height:17px\"><strong>#</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:715px;height:17px\"><strong>Effect</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:18px\">\n<td style=\"width:116.5px;height:18px\">One Ear</td>\n<td style=\"width:715px;height:18px\">You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:116.5px;height:17px\">Both Ears</td>\n<td style=\"width:715px;height:17px\">You are <strong>deafened.</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Sense of Smell and Taste</h2>\n<table style=\"width:836.5px;height:52px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:116.5px;height:17px\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width:715px;height:17px\"><strong>Effect</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:18px\">\n<td style=\"width:116.5px;height:18px\">Smell</td>\n<td style=\"width:715px;height:18px\">You cannot smell.
